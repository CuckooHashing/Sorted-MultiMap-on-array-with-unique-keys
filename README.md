# Sorted-MultiMap-on-array-with-unique-keys
The C++ implementation of a sorted multimap on an array (i.e. a dubly linked list on an array) with unique keys, along with an iterator for it. Since the keys are unique, each element in the array has a link to a different dlla array, on which the values are stored.
